# P2P Client

- User Apple Watch Series 6 or later to use NISession.
- Everytime you run the app, reset both iPhone app and Watch app just in case to avoid any unexpected behaviors.
- Even if you reset them before running, there are chances that connection errors happen since the bluetooth and socket connections are not perfectly stable. Try again!
